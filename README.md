Normal mode: This program exchanges different types of currency using classes
for currency amounts, converter and a trader. The same type  of currencies can be
added and subtracted together but raise an error when different types of currencies
try to do that. An error was created for this and also skipped over so the program
can continue. All currencies can be multiplied by a float or integer. The converter
class is initialized with a hash of exchange rates. It can create a copy of any
currency amount instance or convert any currency to any other known currency. It
has an error if you try to convert to a currency that is not known.

Hard: The program will now recognize currency symbols and a new class currency
trader was created. This class will tell you what currency will make the best
investment.

Nightmare: The program will be able to tell you what the best currency investment
is depending on the amount of years.
